title = "Release: v0.5 - Compile command"
+++

This release adds a compile command and three new language features:

## Variables
Variables provide a way to manage mutable state. Each variable contains a single value. To create a new variable use the var function: `(var value)`

## Namespaced Keywords
If code or data is shared to the outside world keywords can collide. This problem is now solved with namespaced keywords.

## Interfaces
For better abstraction it is now possible to define interfaces in Phel. Structs can now implement these interfaces.
