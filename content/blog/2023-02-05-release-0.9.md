title = "Release: v0.9 - ApiFacade"
+++

This release adds new config parameters and improve the compiling performance.

## ApiFacade

You can use the ApiFacade from your PHP project to get all phel functions. For example, this is used to render the API page: [https://phel-lang.org/api](https://phel-lang.org/api).

## New `doc` command

```bash
$ php phel doc --help
Description:
  Display the docs for any/all phel functions.

Usage:
  doc [options] [--] [<search>]

Arguments:
  search        Search input that look for a similar function name [default: ""]

Options:
      --ns      Specify which namespaces to load. [optional]
```

## New config parameters

### ignore-when-building

This key accept a list of file-names/patterns which will be ignore at building time.

You might have a `src/local.phel` file for your local testing/ideas, and so you want to keep it out of the building process.

### keep-generated-temp-files

This key, `'keep-generated-temp-files'` will decide if you want to remove or keep the generated files `(default: false)`.

Every time we run any phel command (like run, test, doc, etc...), this generates temporal files (with the executable PHP code), which later get `required` and run inside the PHP interpreter.

However, these files are useless after the execution, and running another command will generate a bunch of new files again. The temporal files will get removed at some point, but these files are not needed at all by default; although, this could be useful for debugging.

## Other improvements

* Rename command `phel compile` to `phel build`
* Allow underscores in decimal numbers
