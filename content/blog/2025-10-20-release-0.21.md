+++

Phel v0.21 is all about broadening the way you shape and read code. Multi-arity functions unlock expressive APIs without
boilerplate, while a suite of macro and metadata improvements tighten up contracts and hygiene. With more flexible
comments, smarter destructuring, and a friendlier REPL, this release makes day-to-day development feel smoother from
first keystroke to final evaluation.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Multi-arity functions** let you design natural overloads without branching manually.
- **Comment enhancements** add inline skips via `#_`, an alternative `;` comment symbol, and rich block comments with `#|‚Ä¶|#`.
- **Metadata `pre`/`post` conditions** deliver clearer runtime contracts around your functions.
- **Macro auto-gensym** keeps hygienic macros effortless and robust.
- **Map destructuring with `:keys` and `:as`** brings ergonomic data extraction to bindings.
- **REPL upgrades** surface the running version and forward CLI flags to `phel run` scripts.

## üêõ Bug fixes

- Ensured `.phar` builds autoload Phel classes correctly and resolve namespaces from the working directory.
- Fixed vector and hashmap literal handling inside `try` blocks.
- Restored reliable REPL symbol resolution when loading from the current directory.

## üîß Enhancements

- Updated the default error log file location for a more consistent debugging workflow.
