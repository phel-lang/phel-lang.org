## Going PHARther

### âœ¨ TL;DR

You can now use Phel as a single executable PHAR!

This release introduces a build script that packages the entire Phel runtime and tooling into one standalone file â€” making installation, distribution, and usage easier than ever.

## Highlights

### ðŸ¥‡ New Features

- `str/pad-left` and `str/pad-right` functions for string padding operations
- `trace/dotrace` for low-level runtime tracing
- `trace/dbg` for quick and convenient value debugging
- New `phel ns` command to interact with namespaces
- Added `[inspect]` argument to `phel ns` for viewing namespace metadata
- Script for building a standalone PHAR executable
- Enabled opcache for faster file compilation and execution
- `--clear-opcache` option in `phel run` for clearing PHP opcode cache
