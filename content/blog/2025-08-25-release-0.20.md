## Expanding the Core

### ‚ú® TL;DR

This release expands Phel‚Äôs core with many new functions and macros, unifies and improves collection handling (`reduce`, `take`, `map`, `sets`), and streamlines runtime access through the new Phel facade. It also includes key bug fixes, refined math behavior, and developer workflow enhancements.

## Highlights

### ‚ú® New features

- Unified `reduce` implementation now works without an initial value (removing the need for `reduce2`)
- Added a wide range of core functions such as `select-keys`, `median`, `slurp`, `spit`, `zipmap`, `repeat`, and more, along with aliases like `assoc/assoc-in` and `dissoc/dissoc-in`
- Introduced macros `some->` and `some->>` for optional chaining patterns
- `take` now supports PHP Traversable inputs for safe slicing of generators and other iterables
- Phel serves as the public entry class and proxy for `Registry` methods, exposing additional constructors and helpers

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Resolved `map` exhaustion on empty collections
- Fixed `contains-value?` handling of nil values
- Corrected set `difference` behavior for certain inputs
- Addressed `require` loading when `*build-mode*` is unset
- Prevented coercion of `nil` to 0 in math operations

### üîß Enhancements & Refactors

- Improved `php/->` to support nested calls
- Adopted new `list`, `vector`, `set`, and `map` constructors for cleaner proxying through Phel

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous

- Added an auto-assign-author GitHub workflow to streamline contributions
