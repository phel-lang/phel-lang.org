This release adds a compile command to Phel. Additionally, we added three new languages features:

* Variables
* Namespaced keywords.
* Interfaces and their usage in structs.

Please have a look at the documentation or the Changelog for more information.

As outlook for the next version I would like to mention that we will drop support for PHP version 7.4 and start supporting PHP version 8.1
